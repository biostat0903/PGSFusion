# PGSFusion streamlines polygenic score construction and epidemiological application in biobank scale cohort <br>

## Overview
We develop PGSFusion to perform polygenic score (PGS) construction and epidemiolgical application. PGSFusion accepted many different formats of summary statistics and implements a wide range of PGS methods, including single-trait, multiple-trait, annotation-based, and cross-ancestry methods. PGSFusion provided further epidemiological analysis: i) prediction performance evaluation; and ii) interaction identification. <br>

## PGSFusion pipeline
+ <strong>Processing UKBB data</strong><br>
We used UKBB data to build the validation set and test set. Two sets consist of 50,000 European indiciduals. Four methode, including CT, lassosum2, LDrped2 and DBSLMM, need validation set. <br>
+ <strong>PGS methods</strong><br>
We integrated 16 PGS methods, including single-trait, multiple-trait, annotation-based and cross-ancestry methods. <br>
+ <strong>PGS application</strong><br>
We provided two applications: i) prediction performance evaluation; ii) interaction analysis. <br>
